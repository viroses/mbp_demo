All infrastructure is created throught AWS CDK.

1. We use Slack to get notification and send command to AWS.
2. We use 2 GitHub repository to store your application code and database schema.
   - Application : https://github.com/viroses/shopizer
   - Database schema : https://github.com/viroses/db_cicd


==========================================

Here is how to get started CDK. (https://cdkworkshop.com/)

# Welcome to your CDK Java project!

This is a blank project for Java development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
